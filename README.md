# Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. If not, you can download Anaconda, which includes both Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Install any additional packages or libraries youâ€™ll need for your analysis (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV).
Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/elmunoz42/mars-image-dataset-analysis.git

## Explore the Data:
Place your Mars image dataset (in the form of image files) in the data/ directory.
You can organize the data into subdirectories based on mission, camera type, or any other relevant criteria.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open your terminal or Anaconda prompt.
Navigate to the cloned repository:
cd mars-image-dataset-analysis

## Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

## Analyze the Data:
Create a new Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Mars_Image_Analysis.ipynb).
Load the image data, explore it, and perform any necessary preprocessing.
Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, OpenCV) to visualize and analyze the images.
Extract relevant features or information from the images.
Document Your Work:
Write detailed explanations in Markdown cells within your Jupyter Notebook.
Include code comments to explain your approach and any important steps.
Document any interesting findings or insights.
Share Your Results:
Commit your changes to the repository.
Push the changes to your GitHub account.
Update the README with relevant information about your analysis, dataset, and any conclusions.
